# Visualization-of-H1-B-statistics-using-Tableau 2011-2016
Visualizing the H1- data (2011-2016) using Tableau and finding answers for few queries using Visuals

The H1B Visa petitions 2011-2016 data set will be used for this project. The source site for this dataset is - https://www.kaggle.com/nsharan/h-1b-visa.  It was originally collected from United States Department of Labor - Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC). The Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) generates disclosure data that is useful information about the immigration programs including the H1-B visa. 

Queries that can be answered from the Visualization.

1.	Which is the location from where the maximum number of applications are filed?
2.	What can be the number of visa applications which could be issued next year based on the trending graph?
3.	Is there any increase in the number of H1-B petitions every year?
4.	Which job title has the maximum salary for which H1-B is certified?


These tasks are difficult to conduct with Excel or statistical approaches:<br>
a.	The latitude and longitude of the dataset cannot be portrayed with the help of Excel. <br>
b.	The visa applications which could be issued next year cannot be shown by Excel as Excel does not have the feature of predicting which can be done using Tableau. 
c.	The increase or decrease between two fields cannot be calculated using Excel.
d.	The comparison between two fields cannot be done which is easy with the help of Tableau.
e.	The dataset contains 3 million records which is a very huge amount and Excel can only show 1 million entries. Thus, the answers derived by the dataset using Excel will not be appropriate as they are derived from incomplete data.
